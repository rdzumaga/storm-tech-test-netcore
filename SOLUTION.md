some closing thoughts :)

So as it turned out using MVC/jquery instead of some SPA framework introduced a bit of overhead trying to figure out how to do some rather simple things (since i have not used it since MVC in .NET 4 - i got a bit rusty with it)
With that overhead, and with the fact that i was getting close to 5 hours (that were not to be exceeded) working on this project, i've done 9 out of 10 tasks.
 
Anyway, i would apprecieate feedback on provided solution - especially if it turns out to be not what was expected
And - of course - should there be any questions regarding this soulution feel free to reach out :)
